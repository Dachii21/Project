    <p>First of all, let's start off with who I am - My name is Dachi Chrdileli. I'm 14 years old. I live in Tbilisi, Georgia. My hobbies are coding, playing a guitar and attending the MMA lessons. My school grades are also very good. I'm hoping that I'll be a very successful person one day. I'm planning to become a coder soon, so because of that I attend the GOA lessons. I usually try to do stuff by myself. That's all for now, if you want to learn more about me, go to <a href="aboutme.html">About me</a> page! I'm also quite a decent-skilled person that might be able to help you out in some stuff.</p>
